# Comparison

It really comes down on your use case, if you are just starting up a short project that needs some easy organization, I would consider using CanaryEngine, even larger projects would suit your use of it.

Each framework has each of their own disadvantages and advantages, so it's ultimately up to you to decide what you should use and what suits you best. I always thought many other frameworks available were challenging to learn (at least for me) so I created this framework instead.
