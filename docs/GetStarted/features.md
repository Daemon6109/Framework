# Features

* **Type Safe** 🦺
Strictly typed, along with native support for `roblox-ts`.

* **Context-specific API** 🖥️
The API is aimed to be completely separate the server and the client, which allows for a better type checking experience.

* **Fully Documented** 📚
The entire framework is documented, along with tutorials on each subject.

* **Optimized** 🏃‍♀️
Extremely optimized, with most internal functions running fast along with custom signal and network implementations.

* **Secure** 🔐
The networking system that CanaryEngine uses can actually partially prevent exploits like RemoteSpy from being easily useable.

* **Node Package** 📦
Comes with a native node package for all of you power users on the command line, with Rojo support by default.

... and much more!
