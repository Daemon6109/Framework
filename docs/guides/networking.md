# Networking

There is no stock networking library that comes with the framework, so you can use any library you want to. For a default option, you can use [LuminNet](https://github.com/lumin-dev/LuminNet)

We also recommend:

- **[ByteNet](https://github.com/ffrostfall/ByteNet)** - A networking library focused on hyper-optimization and the usage of buffers
- **[Zap](https://github.com/red-blox/zap)** - A CLI-based library that creates static .zap files for the most optimization
- **[Blink](https://github.com/1Axen/blink)** - A competitor to Zap which does similar things, but has support for studio and different API

But for basic networking, we recommend using LuminNet as the API is less bloated than libraries like BridgeNet or Red. Note that the optimizations of LuminNet are still well over default remote event benchmarks.
