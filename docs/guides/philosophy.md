## Why use Lumin?

Lumin Framework has been worked on for many years, and takes after many other popular frameworks in the development space such as Knit. It has been battle-tested by many and is one of the best frameworks you can use at the time of writing this. It also has a thriving community of like-minded developers that are willing to help; as well as an extensive ecosystem of other packages.

## What about Typescript?

Roblox-ts support will not be added to this project. As the Luau type solver increases its featureset and compatbility, roblox-ts will soon become completely redundant. For this reason, it is not worth supporting any typescript features, especially long-term.

## Alternative Frameworks

You may think to use some of the other frameworks in this list; but don't switch yet. Lumin is constantly evolving and might become better than some of these in the future.

- **Knit** by Sleitnick
- **Nevermore** by Quenty
- **Pronghorn** by Iron Stag Games
- **Prvd 'M Wrong** by Fireboltofdeath

So why not use these? Many of these have been used and cherished by many, but they are not what they live up to be any longer.

- **Knit** - Has been deprecated and has zero types, along with forcing a subpar service and networking API
- **Nevermore** - Introduces hundreds of packages which are complete bloat, as many people do not even use them all. Is not even considered an actual framework either.
- **Pronghorn** - Adds more redundant functions and is missing a lot of the featureset most frameworks have.
- **Prvd 'M Wrong** - Includes API bloat by default and implements lots of hacky metatable features which are not needed. Lumin achieves the same goal with less code overall.
