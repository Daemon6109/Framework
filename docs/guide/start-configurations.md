# Start Configurations

Start configurations allow you to control how the framework behaves in the long run.

## Profiling

This option will enable profiling, which means that the name of each provider will be using when setting the memory category. This happens before `Init` as well as before `Start`. This is false by default.

```luau
{
    Profiling = true
}
```
