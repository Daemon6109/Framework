# Intro

CanaryEngine is an all-new framework built with beginners and power-users in mind. With a built in networking structure thats powerful and super performant, and a package manager that is built into studio, setting up CanaryEngine and using it should be a breeze. One of the main selling points of the framework is that many of the current frameworks like Knit are kind of confusing to use and set up, along with the fact that it doesn't support instances as packages. Nothing special here, CanaryEngine was only designed to organize and manage at scale.
