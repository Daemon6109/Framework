# About

CanaryEngine is the all new framework for all your games and projects, no matter the size of them. I've personally used it for all of my projects, and it works great despite the scale of each one. I designed the framework to have a super optimized networking and signal system. It combines the usage of @ffrostfall's BridgeNet2 and and @stravant's GoodSignal modules, which helps it be optimized by a ton.

It also comes with many other libraries built in, such as @commitblue's BlueSerializer and the framework's own Utility, Benchmark, and Statistics modules. They each cover many of the edge cases that come up lots of times during the development process. A fine example of this is saving instances in datastores.

It was made to be complex, but also easy to learn which is what mainly makes the framework stand out from the others. I have covered almost all of the API and libraries in our documentation, be sure to check that out before starting out with the framework.

Our goal while creating this framework was to not intrude on the developers code, but instead let them customize their experience and give them basic tools along the way, such as the built-in networking system. I have found myself that this actually makes the process of developing a project way faster than before, and is just nicer to work with overall when stuff isn't practically shoved down your throat.

***We want you to have control over how your game functions, and not intrude on your unique process***
